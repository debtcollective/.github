# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

Here are some important resources:

- [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Testing

We have a handful of Jest tests and Cypress features. Please write tests for new code you create.

## Submitting changes

Please open a Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done. We have a Pull Request template you can use to document your changes. When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include tests. We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Please, always write a clear log message for your commits.

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability.
